```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

cadets <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfcaby/MA376AY21/master/data/memorizing%20letters%20(Exploration%201.1)")
```

## Step 3

First, we'll investigate the response variable.

```{r}
cadets %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(group), y = letters)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

The single mean model is:

$$y_i = \mu + \epsilon_i$$
$$\epsilon_i$$ has a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $$\sigma^2$$.

The separate means model is:

$$y_i = \mu_j + \epsilon_{ij}$$

```{r}
cadets %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(letters))
```

We want to know the standard error of the single mean and separate means model.

Single mean model

```{r}
# calculate residuals
cadets = cadets %>% 
  mutate(single.mean = mean(letters),
         single.mean.residual = letters - single.mean)

cadets %>% 
  summarize(single.mean.se = sqrt(sum(single.mean.residual^2)/14))
```
